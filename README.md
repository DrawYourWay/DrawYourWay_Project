# DrawYourWay_Project
The focus of DrawYourWay is on addressing the issue of boredom experienced while waiting for trains, metros, and other public transport. By doing so, it is also hoped that graffiti vandalism at stations can be reduced by providing engaging alternatives for passengers.

This interactive art project aims to engage people who use public transport creatively by allowing them to create drawings that will be displayed as a projection on a wall. By transforming waiting time into a productive and enjoyable experience, the project aims to foster community interaction and provide a platform for self-expression.

The objectives focus on enhancing user participation, ensuring accessibility, introducing weekly themes to keep the content fresh, and creating a visually impactful experience. Additionally, the project strives to reduce boredom and vandalism in metro stations by providing a positive and creative outlet for commuters.

1. Encourage Creativity: Provide metro passengers with a fun and engaging way to express themselves through digital drawing.

2. Improve Waiting Experience: Turn waiting time into a creative and interactive activity, making the waiting experience more enjoyable.

3. Promote Social Interaction: Create a shared space where everyone can contribute to a collective piece of art.

4. Ensure Accessibility: Offer two options for participation, a QR code for mobile online participation and a tablet for those who want to make a more detailed drawing.

5. Variety of topics: Keep engagement fresh by rotating different themes every day or week to inspire new drawings.

6. Create a Visual Impact: Create a visual impact by implementing a screen on the walls of public transport stations, turning them into interactive art galleries.

7. Reduce Vandalism: Provide an alternative for those who want to express their art on the walls, discouraging the need for graffiti or other forms of vandalism in public transport stations.
